VIII Instructions & Programs
- CPU is a piece of hardware controlled by easy to modify software
- Jumps create loops
- Halts are conditionals that exit the jumps (e.g. jump_negatives, jump_if_equal, jump_if_greater)
- Modern CPUs have 1) 32 or 64 bits instruction lengths and 2) variable length instructions to create more options for instructions
- Intel 4004 processor - 46 instructions
- Modern computers have thousands of different instructions and instruction variants 

IX Advanced CPU Designs 
- How do we get data in and out of the CPU quickly?
- RAM is a memory module outside of the CPU, so data has to be transmitted along data wires called a bus, which loads from RAM, and takes time
- One solution: Cache (kilo to megabytes, RAM is gigabytes) stores data blocks in the CPU, no extra bus or load back and forth. 
- Cache Hit = data requested in RAM already stored in Cache
- Cache Miss = data not in Cache, still in RAM
- Cache can also be used as a scratch space to hold intermediate values in a long calculation. 
- Dirty bit - special cache flag, keeps track of cache changes that need to be saved in RAM
- Parallelize - when one instruction is getting executed, another instruction could be decoded, while yet another is being fetched all at the same time, decreasing clock cycles/time. 
    - Hazard: dependency in the instructions, aka using something thatâ€™s old 
    - Pipeline processors have to look ahead for data dependencies, and if necessary, stall pipelines to avoid problems
    - Out of order execution: high end processors can dynamically reorder instructions to keep the pipeline moving. These circuits are very complicated but very effective. 
    - Hazard: Conditional jump instructions, delays while waiting for values to be finalized
    - Speculative execution: CPU guesses which direction and work off that guess 
        - Branch predictions guess with over 90% accuracy
- Superscalar processes allow for more than one instruction per clock cycle
- Multi-core processors: multiple independent processing units inside a single CPU chip
- Share caches and other resources to work together
- High end computers (like datacenter computers) have multi-core processors and multi-CPUs
- Super computers are for monster calculations - in 2017 the Sunway TaiHuLight contains 40,960 CPUs each with 256 cores
- Conclusion: computer processors have gotten both faster and more sophisticated, employing tricks to squeeze out more computations per clock cycle.
